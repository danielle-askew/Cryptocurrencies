# Cryptocurrencies

For this project, we are working with Martha at Accountability Accounting. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So we have created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning. 


In this analysis we learned and applied:

* Data Preprocessing (Selection, Transformation, Scaling): the process of helping to prepare data for Machine Learning Algorithms.
* Elbow Curve: method to determine the best number of clusters needed for the algorithm to group the objects by.
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA): statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when the number of features is too high.
* Clustering Algorithms (KMeans): grouping similar objects/data points into clusters.
* Visualization (hvPlot, Plotly): graphic libraries that allow us to create 2D and 3D graphs such as, scatter plots.
